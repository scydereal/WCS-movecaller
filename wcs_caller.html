            <p>New leads might find it helpful to decouple the skills of "coming up with the next move on the fly" and "executing on a given move".</p>

            <p>The big grid is a transition matrix: the 2nd row's 4th circle size represents how often the 2nd move will lead into the 4th. There are four sizes: never, infrequent, default, and often. Click the circle to change it. This lets you choose things like "this move is a rapid spin and I usually want it to be followed up by moves that spin the follow the other way" or "this move should only follow moves where the follow has time to see the lead wants their other hand".</p>

            <p>Click the column header circle to set all the circles in a column at once (e.g. because you want to temporarily disable transitions into it, or maximize transitions into it because it's a new move you want to practice).</p>

            <p>Use the toggle button to the right to indicate whether a move is a 6 vs 8 count. Add or delete moves with the text input (press enter to submit) and x buttons.</p>
